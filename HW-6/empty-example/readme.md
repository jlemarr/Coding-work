## So... about this week...

This week was by far the most difficult week for me for a number of reasons, most of which I will not get into. This week was to start of confusing for me material wise, and I had very little time to put towards comprehending that material. I did my best, however realize I will need to put extra time in coming back to this material in future weeks in order to fully understand it. However what was most difficult was the assignment.

### So... about this assignment...

This assingment I cannot say I am proud of because it is way more unoriginal than I would normally accept from myself. I had quite a few problems super early on and in the end modified what I wanted to do to closer to what was shown in the example. I was able to modify and custimize it but in the end I mostly followed the example so that I would end with a working sketch. I would not do this in most circumstances. I apologize for the lack of creativity in this weeks assignment.

### Helping!

I had the same problem I had with everything else this week and really didn't have the time or knowledge to be super helpful to anyone. I did surf through there looking for solutions and it did help to a degree but my understanding was still lacking.

### What I do have

What I ended up with was pretty much a larger version of the smoke example. It is a string of partially transparent triangles. I decided to outline them in white and make it move faster as well as enlarging the thing as a whole. Besided this the set up is pretty much the same as the example as I used it as a guideline to follow when I could not make it work on my own.
