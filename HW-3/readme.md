# Homework 3

## Document Creation
This week I created my Hello World sketch choosing to create an indigo background and placing my text in the lower left hand corner. I did this because I thought it looked good and I have no other reasoning for doing so. I picked one of my favorite colors and randomely located the text until I was satisfied.

## Troubleshooting
 This week was pretty easy, I followed the steps pretty closely to get the results that I wanted. I did run into one problem when it came to getting my URL, I had to include the index.html in my URL in order for it to show up for awhile. I fixed this after messing around with it a little bit. I did not use the class repository to figure that out because by trial and error I was able to figure it out by myself.
