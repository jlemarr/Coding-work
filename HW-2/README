# Question 1
## Summarize the work you did this homework cycle.
 This weeks homework was pretty simple and not a whole lot of individual choices to be made. I followed the directions as best I could, I have a pretty good idea of how Github works as well as Atom. I chose to use Atom mostly because it was the first option given and I am enjoying using it so far.

 # Question 2
 ## What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
 I followed the steps given on the website. I read and watched the videos given, then when given TODO:s I would follow those very carefully.

 # Question 3
 ## Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
- I really had no issues with this weeks assignment. It was very straight forward and easy to follow.
- Because I did not have any problems with the assignment I had no purpose to post them to the class repo issue tracker.
- I didn't really have a chance to answer any questions for my fellow classmates unfortunately.

# Question 4
## Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
1. I am excited to further learn how to work Github.
2. I am excited to further learn Atom.
3. I am excited to learn new code commands ie. `git commit`

# Question 5
## What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
Unfortunately I was unable to get onto the [class repo](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding) and help any of my fellow classmates out.
