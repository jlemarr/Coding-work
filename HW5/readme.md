## Week 5 Creative Coding Overview

I admit I was a bit nervous to start this week thinking that I would run into a multitude of problems while attempting to create a moving absract image. However I found I was able to create my image I had in mind with not many problems at all. It went extremely smoothly and had not setbacks as far as error in my code or any program malfunctions. However in atom it sends a message along with the let function saying to use a different version, however this does not seem to effect the functionality of let.

### Abstract shape

I created an abstract shape because I felt that would be more visually interesting to create as well as to choose what whould move and how. I made three triangles choosing to make them all move in slightly different ways, on following mouseY while the other two follow mouseX but at different rates. I also created four cirlcles in grayscale that move consistently in constat motion around my triangles.

### Troubleshooting?

I was unable to be helpful to others in my class this week.
