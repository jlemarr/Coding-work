# MAKING MY MAN

I didn't really have any problems along the way. I ran into a few problems with errors in syntax but I was able to find and fix those quickly. I decided to make an old man because I did not want to make a self portrait and it honestly just kind of happened... I didn't plan it out like we were maybe supposed to, I more just went for it, making executive decisions along the way. It all started when I wanted to give the body shape rather than stay rectangular and so I made my guy slightly chubby. Later I wanted hair but a full head sounded ambitious and so I wanted to make him mostly bald. This is when my character turned old and the tooth just felt right... After that point I felt like he didn't need anymore because I thought he was beautiful. So I guess its not a self portrait or a monster but... sorry... A lot of how I figured out what I wanted was trial and error, especially with placement of lines.
